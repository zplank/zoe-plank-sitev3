Welcome to my site! My name is Zoe Plank and I currently work as a Product Data Scientist for a healthcare analytics company based in Boston. While I call Delray Beach, FL home for now, most of my roots are in Boston and I enjoy traveling back and forth (I may qualify as be the youngest snowbird around :) ). I have been with my current company for almost 5 years and began as an entry level Data Analyst right out of undergrad. I have grown immensely since my start there and when the Director of the Data Science team heard I had started my masters in the field, I was promoted to my current position and have been working with the team ever since. Working in a Data Science role while also being in the MSDS program has been a huge advantage in both my professional and academic career. 

Explore around my site and learn a little more about me!
